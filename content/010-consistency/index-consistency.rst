Consistency
***********

Rules we care about:


- Follow conventions that enable — or even *compel* — consistency
- Be consistent when possible
- ...but not in a way that makes life harder, especially when working as a team


TKTK:

To quote from the Python PEP 8 Style Guide, under the section, `A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds>`_:


    ...A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.




This section deals with syntax that is open to "artistic" interpretation, i.e. the SQL interpreter doesn't care what it looks like, but humans might.
