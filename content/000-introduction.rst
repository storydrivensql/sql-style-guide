SQL has surprisingly few style guides or discussion on style, given how verbose the syntax can be, and how lenient is by convention, especially with whitespace. There are a few good guides, as mentioned in :doc:`/content/resources/index`, from which this guide takes inspiration, and makes notable differences.

I'm also writing my own comprehensive SQL tutorial/reference book, tentatively titled `Story Driven SQL <https://github.com/storydrivensql/>`_, somewhat in the style of `The Bastards Book of Ruby <http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/>`_, but good, and informed by my `few years of teaching SQL to Stanford students as a visiting journalism professor <http://www.padjo.org/>`_.

I have no publish date in sight but I do have empty Github repos/orgs created. This style guide is meant to be a chapter in that book.
