Styleguides for other languages
*******************************

These guides aren't SQL specific, but I include them because they are excellent guides overall, with universal principles and concepts that I'd like my SQL styleguide to embody.


- `PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_: Twenty great aphorisms that apply to any programming language, and to many things outside of programming.
- `PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_: I think Python's design and philosophy is one of the best in all contemporary languages, so unsurprisingly, I believe its styleguide to be very worth reading and stealing from.
